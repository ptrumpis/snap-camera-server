# 👻 Snap Camera Server v4.0
A self hosted solution for Snap Camera.  
It will let you continue to use Snapcamera with almost all Snapchat filters after the shutdown on January 25, 2023.  

**This code is a fork of *jaku/SnapCameraPreservation* on steroids 💪** 
- ✔️ No previously backed up files or third party server required.
- ✔️ Create and use your own Snap Lenses with Lens Studio.
- ✔️ Access most popular Snap Lenses from **snapchat.com/lens**.
- ✔️ Import Lenses from local application cache e.g. `AppData\Local\Snap\Snap Camera\cache\lenses`.
- ✔️ All files will be stored inside a Docker Volume (e.g. on your local machine).
- ✔️ Runs local on Windows, Mac OS or hosted on a remote server.

You get the full decentralized control and you can use *Snap Camera* until Doomsday.

See the [📋 Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of changes and features.
